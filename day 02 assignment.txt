    Document is represent the web page that currently loaded in the window. Where the window it represents the current web browser window.  
    When an HTML document loaded in the web browser it becomes a document object
    The properties related to documents is stored in document object,
    where the properties related to windows is strored in window object.
    Document will be loaded after the loading window because window contains the document, where the windows object will load before the document.
    It is the root element in the document object model(DOM), where the window is the global element for all the object and the function.
    Document is the object of the window, where the window is the object of the browser.
    Where we cannot access the windows object properties indise the document
    But in the windows object we can access document object properties inside the window.
